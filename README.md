# abm_framework
A framework for agent-based simulation. It covers grid-based simulations. 

The model supports grid-based simulations and includes visualization and animation functionality. The module is continously extended to cover additional functionality. For example, I added the Moore neighbourhood as a neighbourhood option for grid-based ABM simulations. In a second step, the Neumann neighbourhood (easy addition) can be added, and then in addition other neighbourhood types as required.


I gave some basic introductions covering the differences between simulation methods as well as basic agent-based simulation modeling in Python -  and you can find these introductions on my blog:
